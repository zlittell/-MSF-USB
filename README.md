# [MSF] USB Connector Library
This is a middleware connector library for talking to HID devices with [USB.net from Christian Findlay](https://github.com/MelbourneDeveloper/Usb.Net).
This creates simple connector code as well as the basis for "messages" to and from the device.
Will publish more information on the protocol used.
